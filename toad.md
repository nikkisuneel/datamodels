tool made by Quest Software and not open-source. The Toad Data Point is a database tool not a database iteself so the most 
popular databases supporting Toad Data Point is the relational data models. This is based on tables of rows and columns. Toad Data Point is a client-side
database tool. This means that it is running on a user's local laptop and not a server or the cloud. For Java and Python they can connect to the database
through using Java Database Connectivity and Open Database Connectivity drivers respecticly. So Java for JDBC and Python for ODBC.
